## Personal styleguide

Sometimes another developer will ask me. *"Hyphens or underscores?"* *"Spaces or tabs?"* That's when I realized that creating a personal styleguide would be the best thing ever.

This styleguide is how I write code. Styleguides are meant to help teams of developers to create a strategy on how they write their code. If you find this useful, I encourage you to [fork it](https://github.com/jonrohan/styleguide) and use it for your own team's guide.

My styleguide is inspired by the styleguides from these awesome developers and organizations. Props are deserved :zap:
