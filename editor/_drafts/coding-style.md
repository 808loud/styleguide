## Coding style

These are general coding styles that I use in most all of my code. It would be pretty rare that I would override these settings, except in specific instances.

### Spaces

Use soft tabs with `2` spaces.

### Encoding

Use `UTF-8` as the source file encoding.

### Whitespace

* Delete trailing whitespace.
* End each file with a blank newline.
