# :sparkles: Personal styleguide :sparkles:

Sometimes another developer will ask me. *"Hyphens or underscores?"* *"Spaces or tabs?"* That's when I realized that creating a personal styleguide would be the best thing ever.

This styleguide is how I write code. Styleguides are meant to help teams of developers to create a strategy on how they write their code. If you find this useful, I encourage you to [fork it](https://github.com/jonrohan/styleguide) and use it for your own team's guide.

## Install

If you really want to run this locally, here's what works on my machine &trade;

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
open http://localhost:4000/
```

## Usage

I've created a nice little bundle of editor style goodies that will match my coding style. You can [download here](/).
