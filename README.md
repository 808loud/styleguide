# :sparkles: Personal styleguide :sparkles:

Sometimes another developer will ask me. *"What are your coding preferences?"* or *"spaces or tabs?"*. That's when I realized that creating a personal styleguide would be the best thing ever.

## Install

If you really want to run this locally, here's what works on my machine &trade;

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
open http://localhost:4000/
```

## Usage

I've created a nice little bundle of editor style goodies that will match my coding style. You can [download here](/).

This styleguide is inspired by some styleguides from these awesome developers and organizations.
